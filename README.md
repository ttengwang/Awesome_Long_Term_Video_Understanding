# Awesome Long-Term Video Understanding

Real-world videos are usually long, untrimmed, and contain several actions (events). Traditionally, video understanding has focused on short-term analysis, such as action recognition, object detection/segmentation, or scene understanding in individual video frames or short video clips. However, with the advent of more advanced technologies and the increasing availability of large-scale video datasets, researchers have started exploring **long-term video understanding**. It involves developing methods that can recognize and understand complex activities, events, or interactions that unfold over longer durations of time. This includes tasks like temporal action detection, dense video captioning, video grounding, future video prediction, and video summarization, among others.

This repository curates a collection of research works specifically focused on long-term videos. This is an active repository and your contributions are always welcome!

## TODO

- [ ] add more details of datasets
- [ ] add a plot to illustrate differences between untrimmed videos and trimmed videos, and also between different localization tasks
